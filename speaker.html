        <h4> Aaron Irizarry</h4>
        <p class="speakers_head">DESIGNING A CULTURE OF DESIGN</p>
        <h6 class="speakers_view">Workplace culture doesn’t start with beanbags, foosball tables, or a beer fridge, and
          it doesn’t end with neckties, PCs, or big corporations. It’s the unwritten rules, behavior, beliefs, and the
          motivations that enable good work to get done, or it’s what stifles a workforce. For design to be most
          effective and for designers to feel valued, we need to work in a culture that embraces design and allows it to
          succeed.</h6>


        <h6 class="speakers_view">In Aaron’s session he will explore how to recognize the traits of organizations that
          *get* design, both large and small. He will share what those teams, departments, and companies have that
          others don’t, and more importantly, how to begin to change your own workplace’s culture. Once you’ve worked
          within a culture of design it’s almost impossible to imagine yourself anywhere else.</h6>

        <p class="speakers_head">ABOUT AARON</p>

        <p class="speakers_head">LIGHTS! CAMERA! INTERACTION! DESIGN INSPIRATION FROM FILMMAKERS</p>
        <h6 class="speakers_view">Films succeed in evoking responses and engaging audiences only with a combination of
          well-written narrative and effective storytelling technique. It’s the filmmaker’s job to put this together. To
          do so they’ve developed processes, tools and techniques that allow them to focus attention, emphasize
          information, foreshadow and produce the many elements that together comprise a well-told story.</h6>


        <h6 class="speakers_view">With this workshop, we’ll revisit the topic of using stories in design and expand on
          the technical aspects used in film to communicate. We’ll look at some tools used in film, such as cinematic
          patterns, beat sheets, and storyboards. We’ll consider why they’re used and how we might look to them for
          inspiration.</h6>

        <p class="speakers_head">ABOUT ADAM</p>


        <h6 class="speakers_view">Adam Connor is a designer, illustrator and speaker passionate about collaboration,
          communication, creativity and storytelling. As an Experience Design Director with Mad*Pow, Adam combines 10+
          years of experience in interaction and experience design with a background in computer science, film, and
          animation to create effective and easy-to-use digital products and services. He believes that no matter how
          utilitarian a tool is, at the core of its creation lies a story; uncovering that story is key to its success.

        <h6 class="speakers_view">Static wireframes are a drag on the whole design process. Prototyping makes things a
          little better by allowing you to stitch together static wireframes or mockups while adding basic interactions.
          Rapid prototyping with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is even better and faster; it increases collaboration and
          improves the iteration process. Kill your wireframes. Long live rapid prototyping.</h6>
